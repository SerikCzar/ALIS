  recursive iteration through image utilizing space scan
    storing this somewhere
    test will need to be rewritten to handle 3D arrays
      creates an array of matrices
      each array spot holds a letter matrix
      each matrix represents a letter
  toDo:
    Serik: work on JButton?
    Garret: share JFrame and JButton code

    Serik: link JButton to file chooser for UI
    Serik: design UI
    Serik: distribute UI

      ----> Need to figure out how to do this
        **may possibly need rewrite of a lot of code**
